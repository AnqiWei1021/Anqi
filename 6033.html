                    In the digital era, people often describe digital technology as efficient, convenient, and dematerialized. However, in 2025, I participated in the course of DH6033: Conceptual Introduction to Digital Arts and Humanities, and I gradually realized that digital technology is more complex than our imagination. The operation of digital technology is deeply dependent on a huge material infrastructure, an enormous amount of energy resources, and also company bring some risks of society and ethics. Actually, digital technology is not detached from the real world; in contrast, it is deeply involved in all aspects of the environmental system, labor relationship, and creates knowledge. When people discuss AI, they prefer to emphasize its algorithmic ability, calculation efficiency, and technology innovation, and ignore the real conditions behind AI. This includes continuous consumption of energy in large data centers, the exploitation of mineral resources, the cost of labor in the global manufacturing chain, and the complex supply system to support its operation. Meanwhile, digital humanities are often seen as a research activity of knowledge and culture. With the rapid development of digital technology, it more deeply relies on digital infrastructure, and it also brings the issue of environmental and resource consumption cannot be ignored.
