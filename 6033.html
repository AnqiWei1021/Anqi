        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>In the digital era, people often describe digital technology as efficient, convenient, and dematerialized. However, in 2025, I participated in the course of DH6033: Conceptual Introduction to Digital Arts and Humanities, and I gradually realized that digital technology is more complex than our imagination. The operation of digital technology is deeply dependent on a huge material infrastructure, an enormous amount of energy resources, and also company bring some risks of society and ethics. Actually, digital technology is not detached from the real world; in contrast, it is deeply involved in all aspects of the environmental system, labor relationship, and creates knowledge. When people discuss AI, they prefer to emphasize its algorithmic ability, calculation efficiency, and technology innovation, and ignore the real conditions behind AI. This includes continuous consumption of energy in large data centers, the exploitation of mineral resources, the cost of labor in the global manufacturing chain, and the complex supply system to support its operation. Meanwhile, digital humanities are often seen as a research activity of knowledge and culture. With the rapid development of digital technology, it more deeply relies on digital infrastructure, and it also brings the issue of environmental and resource consumption cannot be ignored. </p>
        <p>Therefore, this article will conduct reflections from three interrelated levels:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        Understand that the operation of AI relies on the exploitation of resources,
        collected data, and the global supply chain.
    </li>

    <li>
        Discuss how digital technology brings energy consumption and environmental
        issues, rethinking how digital humanities can reduce its influence.
    </li>

    <li>
        Analyze how large models may bring biases, misinformation, and their impact
        on society and knowledge production.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>I hope that this article can remind us that in the digital humanities era, we cannot only see the convenience that AI technology brings, but also need to focus on the aspects of ethics, the environment, and its influence on the system.</p>
<h2>The operation of AI relies on the exploitation of resources, collected data, and the global supply chain.</h2>

<p>
Before reading the article <em>“Anatomy of an AI System” (Crawford & Joler, 2018)</em>, 
my understanding of AI devices still stayed on the surface layer. They are convenient, 
intelligent, and can help me complete some simple instructions, such as in China 
“XiaoAi Classmates” by <em>Xiaomi</em> Corporation, which seems popular as Echo by Amazon, 
like turning on the light or turning off the light, playing a video, and so on. 
However, I had never thought about where these devices come from and how they operate. 
This article straightforwardly showed me that behind all seems smart and convenient 
functions, there is a huge material investment in the real world.
</p>
<p>
First, about the exploitation of resources. Intelligent devices need batteries, chips, 
and sensors etc., all of which rely on earth-limited and non-renewable materials, such as 
Lithium, Cobalt, and rare earth elements <em>(Crawford & Joler, 2018)</em>. Before, I just 
thought that intelligent devices were becoming cheaper, but I never realized that behind 
this cheapness is the Earth’s resources have been accelerated exploitation and consumption. 
The anatomy of this article made me realized that whether Echo or XiaoAi Classmates, they 
all rely on a supply chain built on the Earth’s resources, and this exploitation not only 
damages ecology but also does not conform to the principle of sustainable development. We 
pursue a smart lifestyle, yet we are seriously hiding the costs of environmental damage and 
resource damage.

<p>Second, about the data and privacy. When an AI device carries out our instructions, it will also continuously record and analyze users’ daily behavior data, like work and rest schedules, voice content, interest preferences, family activity patterns, etc. This data is usually collected in the background, and these data will connect to the cloud, where it is uploaded, stored, and further processed. They are not only applicable in response to the users’ instructions, but also will be used in training models and the construction of user profiles. In this structure, users’ details of life will be systematically transformed into computable data assets. Privacy is transferred from individuals to technical systems, the device records voice, usage time, and background sounds can be used to infer users’ emotions, lifestyles, and family conditions, and these analyses can often not be found by users, even find it, users cannot understand what this function. This leads to intelligence devices understanding users more, and users' control over their own data rights will be weakened, and the privacy boundary will also be redefined by technology.</p>
