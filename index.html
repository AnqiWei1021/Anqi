            I create research-driven narratives that live online: experiments with language,
            photography, and small interactive gestures that invite people to feel and think.

        <p class="hello">Hiiiii, everyone.</p>
        <p>
            I’m Anqi Wei, currently studying MA Digital Arts & Humanities at UCC. My work moves between
            research, storytelling and digital media, exploring how technology, memory and everyday life collide.
        </p>
        <p>
            I like working with text, images and small interactive moments, and I’m especially curious about how
            people feel, respond and reshape meaning in digital spaces.
        </p>
        <p id="contact">
            When I’m not studying, you’ll probably find me walking in the city, taking photos, or collecting tiny
            fragments of stories.
